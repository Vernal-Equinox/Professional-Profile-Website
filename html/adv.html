              As a Computer Science student, I am passionate about harnessing the power 
              of technology to solve real-world problems and create a more equitable and 
              inclusive society. I believe that technology should not only be a tool for 
              innovation but also a force for positive social change. In an era where technology 
              is rapidly evolving, I advocate for its ethical development and responsible use. 
              From artificial intelligence to data privacy, I am committed to promoting practices 
              that prioritize transparency, fairness, and inclusivity. My goal is to ensure that 
              technological advancements benefit everyone, particularly those from marginalized 
              communities who are often left behind in the digital divide. I strongly believe that 
              access to technology is a fundamental right, and I work towards closing the gap by 
              supporting initiatives that provide digital literacy, resources, and opportunities 
              to underserved populations. Additionally, I am committed to advancing ethical frameworks 
              in technology that address issues such as algorithmic bias, accessibility, and cybersecurity.
