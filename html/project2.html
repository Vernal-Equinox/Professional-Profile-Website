                The platform features a public-facing website with an intuitive appointment booking system that allows 
                pet owners to schedule visits by selecting their preferred veterinarian, specifying appointment types, 
                and providing pet details.

                The system includes a robust admin dashboard that gives clinic staff real-time visibility into operational 
                metrics, including appointment volumes, user counts, and veterinarian availability. Through the dashboard's 
                appointment management interface, administrators can track and update booking statuses, monitor scheduled 
                visits, and oversee the entire practice workflow from a centralized console.
