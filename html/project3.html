            <h3>About the Project</h3>
            <p>
                This is a simple 2D Jet Game where players control a jet fighter navigating through a series of enemy. 
                The game is developed using C++ for the core logic and OpenGL for rendering the 2D graphics.
                In this game, players are tasked with avoiding the enemy, dodging incoming enemy fire, and collecting 
                power-ups to enhance their jet’s abilities. The game features simple yet engaging mechanics, smooth 
                animations, and responsive controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system is designed to be lightweight, optimized for performance, and capable of running on most 
                devices that support OpenGL. The simplicity of the 2D environment allows the focus to be on smooth 
                gameplay, quick reflexes, and achieving high scores.
