          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            The Cleft2Speech is a web-based application designed to assist patients recovering from cleft repair surgery 
            in improving their articulation and speech quality. The system leverages advanced technologies such as 
            Transformer-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Phoneme Mapping, and Speech Synthesis to create an 
            immersive, patient-centric experience aimed at improving speech patterns and restoring vocal confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            This application aims to bridge the gap between medical recovery and speech rehabilitation by enabling 
            patients to practice and correct their speech in a supportive and intuitive digital environment.

          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <div class="features-grid">
            <div class="feature-item">
              <h3>Transformer-based ASR Engine</h3>
              <p>The system can process and transcribe real-time speech, making it suitable for dynamic correction and feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
              <h3>Phoneme Mapping and Error Detection</h3>
              <p>The system utilizes phoneme mapping to compare the patient’s speech with predefined correct phonetic and graphemic models.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
              <h3>Speech Synthesis with Voice Cloning</h3>
              <p>Patients can listen to their own corrected speech, which provides a clearer model for them to emulate in subsequent practice sessions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
              <h3>Intuitive Web-Based Interface</h3>
              <p>Patients can simply speak into the microphone to receive real-time feedback and listen to corrected speech, creating an engaging and non-intimidating rehabilitation experience.</p>
